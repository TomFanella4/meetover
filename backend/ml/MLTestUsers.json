This position is a Product Manager in the Customer Experience team for Fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Global Selling organization. Our vision is to transform global commerce by bringing selection from around the world to Customers anywhere in the world ,  with the same great customer experience Buyers expect from Amazon. In this role ,  you will set strategy and policy ,  build processes ,  and evangelize for technology solutions that allow third party Sellers from all over the world to bring hundreds of millions of new items to Amazon's 11 Marketplaces worldwide. You will determine what experience these Sellers must offer our customers ,  create the incentives and enforcement mechanisms to achieve this experience ,  and frequently audit the results. Responsibilities for this position will include creation of programs that drive improvement in our key customer experience metrics ,  management of global programs and stakeholders ,  and driving alignment for new programs at high levels of the organization. This position will also have management responsibility for product managers ,  data analysts ,  and an operations team. From Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon shareholders: \"To further globalize Marketplace ,  we're now helping sellers in each of our geographies - and in countries where we don't have a presence - reach out to our customers in countries outside their home geographies. We hosted merchants from more than 100 different countries last year ,  and helped them connect with customers in 185 nations. Almost one-fifth of our overall third-party sales now occur outside the sellers' home countries ,  and our merchants' cross-border sales nearly doubled last year. In the EU ,  sellers can open a single account ,  manage their business in multiple languages ,  and make products available across our five EU websites. More recently ,  we've started consolidating cross-border shipments for sellers and helping them obtain ocean shipping from Asia to Europe and North America at preferential ,  bulk rates.\" Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is an Amazon service for our third-party Sellers. The FBA team partners with Sellers and our Amazon Fulfillment Centers to create a seamless experience for Sellers to leverage our world-class facilities. 71% of our FBA Sellers report more than a 20% increase in unit sales after joining FBA. In a very real way ,  we are changing lives with the work we do. Our FBA employees wake up every day thinking about how to enable our Sellers to be successful on our platform. Enabling Seller success allows us to provide Amazon customers with unparalleled selection and pricing. FBA is a win for Sellers and a win for customers. Want to learn more about FBA? ?
